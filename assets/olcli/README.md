- 📊 **Output** compile artifacts (`.bbl`, `.log`, `.aux` for arXiv submissions)

**Perfect for:**
- Editing LaTeX in your preferred text editor (Vim, VS Code, Emacs, etc.)
- Version control with Git while using Overleaf's compiler
- Automating workflows and CI/CD pipelines
- Offline work with periodic sync
- Collaborative projects where some prefer CLI, others prefer web

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew tap aloth/tap
brew install olcli
```

### npm (all platforms)

Install globally to use the `olcli` command anywhere:

```bash
npm install -g @aloth/olcli
```

Or use with `npx` without installation:

```bash
npx @aloth/olcli list
```

### For AI agents (via AgentSkills)

```bash
npx skills add aloth/olcli
```

### Arch Linux

The package is available on the [Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/olcli). 

You can install it using your preferred AUR helper (such as `yay` or `paru`):

```bash
yay -S olcli
# or
paru -S olcli
```

#### Manual Installation:
If you prefer not to use an AUR helper, you can build and install the package manually using makepkg:
code Bash

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/olcli.git
cd olcli
makepkg -si
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Authenticate with Overleaf

Get your session cookie from Overleaf.com:

1. Log into [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com)
2. Open Developer Tools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) → Application/Storage → Cookies
3. Copy the value of `overleaf_session2`

Store it with olcli:

```bash
olcli auth --cookie "your_session_cookie_value"
```

**Tip:** The cookie stays valid for weeks. Just refresh it when authentication fails.

### 2. List Your Projects

```bash
olcli list
```

See all your Overleaf projects with IDs and last modified dates.

### 3. Pull a Project Locally

Download any project to work on it locally:

```bash
olcli pull "My Thesis"
cd My_Thesis/
```

Now you can edit `.tex` files with your preferred editor (Vim, VS Code, Emacs, etc.).

### 4. Edit Locally, Sync to Overleaf

```bash
# Edit files locally with your favorite editor
vim main.tex

# Push changes back to Overleaf
olcli push

# Or sync bidirectionally (pull + push in one command)
olcli sync
```

Your collaborators can continue using the Overleaf web editor — changes sync seamlessly.

### 5. Compile and Download PDF

Use Overleaf's remote compiler from the command line:

```bash
olcli pdf
```

The compiled PDF downloads automatically to your current directory.

### Edit entirely on Overleaf

`edit` replaces an existing Overleaf text document through the remote API and
verifies the saved result. It does not create a local project copy.

```bash
olcli edit main.tex "My Thesis" --content '\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}Hello\\end{document}'
olcli edit main.tex "My Thesis" --from /tmp/replacement.tex
printf '%s' '\\section{Remote edit}' | olcli edit chapter.tex "My Thesis" --stdin
olcli replace main.tex 'old sentence' 'new sentence' "My Thesis"
olcli insert main.tex '\\section{Method}' $'\nNew paragraph.' "My Thesis"
olcli insert main.tex '\\end{document}' $'New appendix.\n' "My Thesis" --before
olcli append notes.tex $'\nOne more note.' "My Thesis"
olcli mkdir figures/generated "My Thesis"
olcli write chapters/new.tex "My Thesis" --content '\\section{New chapter}'
olcli upload plot.png "My Thesis" --to figures/generated/plot.png
```

`replace` requires one exact match by default, preventing accidental broad
changes. Pass `--all` explicitly to replace every match. `insert` targets the
first anchor by default; use `--occurrence 2` for a later exact occurrence.

### Persistent low-latency mode

`live` authenticates and downloads the project snapshot once, keeps the HTTP
connection, file contents, and folder IDs in memory, then accepts one JSON
object per line. Writes skip the full download verification by default and
return their measured `elapsedMs`.

```bash
olcli live "My Thesis"
{"op":"replace","path":"main.tex","search":"old","replacement":"new"}
{"op":"insert","path":"main.tex","anchor":"\\end{document}","text":"Appendix text\\n","before":true}
{"op":"write","path":"chapters/new.tex","content":"\\section{New}"}
{"op":"upload","localPath":"/tmp/plot.png","path":"figures/plot.png"}
{"op":"compile"}
{"op":"refresh"}
{"op":"quit"}
```

Start with `--verify` when every write must be downloaded and checked; this is
safer but intentionally slower. Use `refresh` when collaborators changed the
project after the live session started.

## Use Cases

### Local Editing with Overleaf Compilation

Work offline in your favorite editor, push when ready, compile remotely:

```bash
olcli pull "Research Paper"
cd Research_Paper
vim introduction.tex
git commit -am "Update intro"
olcli push
olcli pdf
```

### Git Version Control + Overleaf

Keep your LaTeX project in Git while using Overleaf's compiler:

```bash
olcli pull "My Thesis" thesis
cd thesis
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial import from Overleaf"

# Daily workflow
vim chapters/methods.tex
git commit -am "Draft methods section"
olcli sync  # Sync with Overleaf
olcli pdf
```

### Automated Workflows

Integrate Overleaf compilation into CI/CD:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
olcli auth --cookie "$OVERLEAF_SESSION"
olcli pull "Automated Report"
./generate-data.py > tables/results.tex
olcli push
olcli pdf -o report-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).pdf
```

### arXiv Submissions

Download the `.bbl` file for arXiv submissions:

```bash
olcli output bbl --project "My Paper"
# Downloads: bbl
```

List all available compile output files:

```bash
olcli output --list
# Available output files:
#   aux          output.aux
#   bbl          output.bbl
#   blg          output.blg
#   log          output.log
#   ...
```

## Sync Behavior

### Pull
- Downloads all files from Overleaf
- **Skips** local files modified after last pull (won't overwrite your changes)
- Use `--force` to overwrite local changes

### Push
- Uploads files modified after last pull
- Preserves nested folder structure when uploading
- Filters out LaTeX build artifacts and OS noise (see [Ignoring files](#ignoring-files))
- Use `--all` to upload all files
- Use `--dry-run` to preview changes
- Use `--show-ignored` to see what was filtered out

### Sync
- Pulls remote changes
- Preserves local modifications (local wins if newer)
- Pushes local changes to remote
- **Propagates local deletions to the remote** — if you delete a file locally, it's deleted on Overleaf on the next sync. Use `--no-delete` to opt out.
- Filters out LaTeX build artifacts and OS noise
- Use `--verbose` to see detailed file operations
- Use `--dry-run` to preview without applying

#### How deletion propagation works

On every sync, `olcli` records a manifest of remote files in `.olcli.json`. The next sync compares the manifest against your local working tree:

- File missing locally **and** still present on remote → deleted on Overleaf
- File new locally → uploaded
- File modified locally after last pull → uploaded (local wins)
- File only on remote → downloaded

First-time syncs skip the deletion phase (no manifest exists yet to distinguish "never had it" from "deleted it").

## Ignoring files

`olcli` automatically filters local files through a layered ignore list before uploading. This keeps LaTeX build artifacts (from local `pdflatex`/`latexmk` runs) and OS noise out of your Overleaf project.

### Three layers

| Layer | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | (built-in) | LaTeX intermediates (`.aux`, `.bbl`, `.log`, `.fls`, `.synctex.gz`, beamer/biber/glossaries/minted), OS noise (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.swp`), common build dirs (`build/`, `out/`, `_minted-*/`). Always on; opt out with `--no-default-ignore`. |
| 2 | `.olignore` | Project-level patterns, gitignore syntax. Commit alongside your `.tex` sources. |
| 3 | `.olignore.local` | Machine-specific patterns. Add to `.gitignore`. |

Later layers override earlier ones, just like git. Negation (`!important.aux`) is supported.

### Special PDF rule

`X.pdf` is ignored only if a same-named `X.tex` (or `.ltx`) exists in the same folder. So `thesis.pdf` next to `thesis.tex` is filtered, but a hand-uploaded `figures/diagram.pdf` still syncs.

### Example `.olignore`

```gitignore
# Drafts that should never reach Overleaf
*.draft.tex
notes/
chapters/scratch/

# But keep this one auxiliary file
!important.aux
```

### Inspecting and overriding

```bash
olcli ignored                  # list patterns currently in effect
olcli push --show-ignored      # see what was skipped on this run
olcli sync --no-default-ignore # only .olignore applies
olcli sync --no-ignore         # escape hatch — upload everything
```

## Configuration

Credentials are stored in (checked in order):

1. `OVERLEAF_SESSION` environment variable
2. `.olauth` file in current directory
3. Global config: `~/.config/olcli-nodejs/config.json` (macOS/Linux)

### .olauth File

For project-specific credentials, create `.olauth` in your project directory:

```
s%3AyourSessionCookieValue...
```

### Self-hosted Overleaf / ShareLaTeX

You can point `olcli` at a self-hosted instance and override the session cookie name.

```bash
olcli --base-url https://latex.example.org list
olcli --base-url https://latex.example.org --cookie-name overleaf.sid whoami
```

Persist these settings in `olcli` config:

```bash
olcli config set-url https://latex.example.org
olcli config set-cookie-name overleaf.sid
```

## Examples

### Work on a thesis

```bash
# Initial setup
olcli pull "PhD Thesis" thesis
cd thesis

# Daily workflow
vim chapters/introduction.tex
olcli sync
olcli pdf -o draft.pdf
```

### Quick PDF download

```bash
olcli pdf "Conference Paper" -o paper.pdf
```

### Download a single file

```bash
olcli download main.tex "My Project"
```

### Upload figures

```bash
cd my-project
olcli upload figures/diagram.png
```

### Backup all projects

```bash
for proj in $(olcli list --json | jq -r '.[].name'); do
  olcli zip "$proj" -o "backups/${proj}.zip"
done
```

### Prepare for arXiv

```bash
cd my-paper
olcli output bbl -o main.bbl
olcli zip -o arxiv-submission.zip
```

## Troubleshooting

### Session expired

If you get authentication errors, your session cookie may have expired. Get a fresh one from the browser and run `olcli auth` again.

### Compilation fails

Check the Overleaf web editor for detailed error logs. Common issues:
- Missing packages
- Syntax errors in `.tex` files
- Missing bibliography files
